= Playground

This project experiments with efficiently parsing AsciiDoc in the VERY limited
arena of a Hubitat Groovy Sandbox (HGS).

Efficient parsing is possible - even with the severe limitations of HGS.

That said, AsciiDoc is orthogonal to current work targets and is being parked for now.

== Status at Time of Park

* BlockF.groovy is a toy Hubitat application.
* Included elements in the "parked as is" code, include:
** A strategy for parsing text efficiently.
** Uses *BLOCK_STASH* exchange text for a key (timestamp).
** Use of compiled RE/Matchers to perform efficient `replaceAll()`.
** Use of a custom `replaceAllWithFn()` to intercept replacements
that require custom handling - e.g, stashing.
** Use of `@Field static Closure` to write Closures for methods/functionality
not available in HBS.
** Use of parameter Maps to feed supplemental data to fewer such closures.

== Next Steps if Resumed

* Decide what Closures are required to "finalize" (wrap and stash) intermediate terms.
* Adjust REs to said Closures
* Punctuate HTML for proper whitepace, font size, etc.
